## DRAGON

## DEMON

    - Formatting the time
## TIGER
- Improve the efficiency of rendering by skipping rendering when nothing has changed
    - Develop a system for trying to flag if a change has occured that requires rendering
## WOLF
- Rewrite Piece struct to use bitwise operations to get the data from it
- Change my style
    - Maybe change from snake_case to pascal case
    - Rename all typedefs structs to name_t to signify typedef if I stick with snake_case
